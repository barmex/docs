## DISTINCT {#distinct}

Selecting unique rows.

{% note info %}

Applying `DISTINCT` to calculated values is not currently implemented. For this purpose, use a subquery or the clause [`GROUP BY ... AS ...`](../../group_by.md).

{% endnote %}

**Example**

``` yql
SELECT DISTINCT value -- only unique values from the table
FROM my_table;
```

The `DISTINCT` keyword can also be used to apply [aggregate functions](../../../builtins/aggregation.md) only to distinct values. For more information, see the documentation for [GROUP BY](../../group_by.md).
