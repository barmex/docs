# INSERT INTO

Adds rows to the table. If you try to insert a row into a table with an existing primary key value, the operation fails with the `PRECONDITION_FAILED` error code and the `Operation aborted due to constraint violation: insert_pk` message returned.


`INSERT INTO` lets you perform the following operations:

* Adding constant values using [`VALUES`](../values.md).

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO my_table (Key1, Key2, Value1, Value2)
  VALUES (345987,'ydb', 'Pied piper', 1414);
  COMMIT;
  ```

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO my_table (key, value)
  VALUES ("foo", 1), ("bar", 2);
  ```

* Saving the `SELECT` result.

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO my_table
  SELECT Key AS Key1, "Empty" AS Key2, Value AS Value1
  FROM my_table1;
  ```
